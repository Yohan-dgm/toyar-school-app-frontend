### 4. Testing
- [ ] Unit tests pass
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Security tests pass
- [ ] Performance tests pass
- [ ] Manual testing on multiple devices

## Environment Setup

### Production Environment Variables
Create a production `.env` file with the following variables:

```bash
# DeepSeek API Configuration
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your-production-api-key
DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL=https://api.deepseek.com/v1

# Security Configuration
APP_SECRET=your-strong-app-secret-key
RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS=10
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW=60000

# Environment
NODE_ENV=production
```

### API Key Security
1. **Domain Restrictions**: Configure your DeepSeek API key to only work from your app's domains
2. **IP Restrictions**: If possible, restrict API access to specific IP ranges
3. **Usage Monitoring**: Set up monitoring for API usage and unusual patterns

## EAS Build Configuration

### 1. Install EAS CLI
```bash
npm install -g @expo/eas-cli
eas login
```

### 2. Configure Project
```bash
eas build:configure
```

### 3. Build for Different Environments

#### Development Build
```bash
eas build --profile development --platform all
```

#### Preview Build
```bash
eas build --profile preview --platform all
```

#### Production Build
```bash
eas build --profile production --platform all
```

## Security Configuration

### 1. DeepSeek API Security
- Set up API key restrictions in DeepSeek dashboard
- Configure allowed domains/origins
- Set up usage alerts and limits
- Monitor API usage patterns

### 2. App Security Measures
- Enable code obfuscation in production builds
- Implement certificate pinning if needed
- Set up crash reporting (Sentry, Bugsnag)
- Configure proper app permissions

### 3. Rate Limiting
The app implements multiple layers of rate limiting:
- Client-side rate limiting (10 requests/minute per device)
- Device fingerprinting for tracking
- Automatic blocking for abuse
- Graceful degradation when limits are hit

## Performance Monitoring

### 1. Metrics to Monitor
- API response times
- App startup time
- Memory usage
- Crash rates
- User engagement

### 2. Performance Tools
- React Native Performance Monitor
- Flipper for debugging
- Custom performance tracking
- Memory leak detection

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Pre-Deployment
```bash
# Run tests
yarn test

# Check for security issues
yarn audit

# Build and test locally
yarn build

# Verify environment variables
yarn env:check
```

### 2. Build and Deploy
```bash
# Build for production
eas build --profile production --platform all

# Submit to app stores
eas submit --profile production --platform all
```

### 3. Post-Deployment
- Monitor crash reports
- Check API usage metrics
- Verify security measures are working
- Monitor user feedback
- Set up alerts for issues

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### 1. API Monitoring
- Set up alerts for API failures
- Monitor rate limit violations
- Track API costs and usage
- Monitor response times

### 2. App Monitoring
- Crash reporting and analysis
- Performance metrics tracking
- User behavior analytics
- Security incident monitoring

### 3. Regular Maintenance
- Update dependencies regularly
- Review and rotate API keys
- Update security measures
- Performance optimization
- User feedback integration

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### API Key Issues
- Verify API key is correctly set in environment
- Check API key restrictions and permissions
- Verify domain/IP restrictions
- Check API usage limits

#### Rate Limiting Issues
- Review rate limit configuration
- Check device fingerprinting
- Verify rate limit storage (AsyncStorage)
- Monitor rate limit violations

#### Performance Issues
- Check memory usage patterns
- Review network request optimization
- Verify lazy loading implementation
- Monitor bundle size

#### Security Issues
- Verify content sanitization
- Check request signature validation
- Review session management
- Monitor for suspicious activity
