```

### 🧭 Navigation Configuration

Each user category has a unique 4-tab bottom navigation:

#### Common Navigation Pattern:

1. **Activity Feed** - Always the home/index route
2. **School Calendar** - Common to all users
3. **Role-Specific Tab** - Unique to each user type
4. **User Actions** - Scalable placeholder for future features

#### Navigation Examples:

**Parent (Category 1):**

- Activity Feed → Student Growth → Student Profile → Notifications

**Educator (Category 2):**

- Activity Feed → School Calendar → User Actions → Notifications

**Senior Management (Category 3):**

- Activity Feed → School Calendar → Strategic → User Actions

**Principal (Category 4):**

- Activity Feed → School Calendar → Academic → User Actions

**Security (Category 11):**

- Activity Feed → School Calendar → Incidents → User Actions

### 🏗️ Architecture Benefits

#### 1. **Scalability**

- Easy to add new user categories
- Consistent file structure
- Reusable components

#### 2. **Maintainability**

- Clear separation of concerns
- Standardized navigation patterns
- Common component library

#### 3. **Flexibility**

- User-specific features in dedicated folders
- Shared components for common functionality
- Easy to customize per user type

### 🔧 Technical Implementation

#### Updated Files:

- ✅ `src/constants/userCategories.ts` - Updated with all 12 categories
- ✅ `src/config/navigationConfig.ts` - Navigation for each category
- ✅ All user category layouts and index files
- ✅ Common school calendar component
- ✅ User actions placeholder for all categories

#### Common Components Created:

- ✅ `src/components/common/calendar/CommonSchoolCalendar.tsx`
- ✅ Shared activity feed (existing)
- ✅ Dynamic user layout system (existing)

### 🚀 Future Scalability

#### Adding New User Categories:

1. Add to `USER_CATEGORIES` constant
2. Add navigation configuration
3. Create folder structure: `/authenticated/{category_name}/`
4. Add layout file with routes
5. Create index and user-actions pages

#### Adding New Features:

1. Create in `user-actions.tsx` initially
2. Move to dedicated files when features grow
3. Use common components where possible
4. Follow established patterns

### 📱 User Experience

#### Consistent Experience:

- Same bottom navigation pattern across all user types
- Common activity feed and school calendar
- Role-specific features in dedicated sections
- Intuitive navigation structure

#### Customization Per Role:

- Each user type sees relevant functionality
- Navigation icons and titles match user context
- Content tailored to user responsibilities

### 🔐 Login Integration

The login system automatically routes users to their designated interface based on `user_category` field:

```typescript
// Login redirect logic
const userCategory = userData.user_category;
const categoryName = getUserCategoryName(userCategory);
router.replace(`/authenticated/${categoryName}`);
```

### ✨ Implementation Status

- ✅ **All 12 User Categories Created**
- ✅ **Folder Structure Established**
- ✅ **Navigation Configured**
- ✅ **Layout Files Created**
- ✅ **Common Components Implemented**
- ✅ **User Actions Placeholders Added**
- ✅ **School Calendar Integration**
- ✅ **Login Routing Updated**

### 🔄 Migration Notes

- Legacy `top_management` folder remains for backward compatibility
- Can be migrated to `senior_management` when ready
- All new development should use the new structure
- Existing parent/educator implementations preserved

---

**Ready for Production**: This implementation provides a solid foundation for the multi-role school management system with excellent scalability and maintainability.
