# Activity Feed Assets

This folder contains assets for the activity feed component.

## Required Files:

### Video
- `video/college.mp4` - Sample college video for posts

### Images  
- `images/img.jpeg` - Sample image for posts

### PDF
- `pdf/nexis.pdf` - Sample PDF document for posts

## Note:
Please add the actual media files to their respective folders:
- Video files should be placed in the `video/` folder
- Image files should be placed in the `images/` folder  
- PDF files should be placed in the `pdf/` folder

The app will gracefully handle missing assets by showing placeholder content.
