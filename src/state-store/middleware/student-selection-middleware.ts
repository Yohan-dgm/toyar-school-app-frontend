 * Middleware to handle student selection changes and refresh activity feed tabs
 * 
 * This middleware intercepts student selection actions and ensures that:
 * 1. When a student is selected, the student posts slice is updated with the new student ID
 * 2. When a student is selected, the class posts slice is updated with the new class ID
 * 3. This triggers automatic refresh of the Class and Student tabs in the activity feed
 * 
 * This ensures that all activity feed tabs stay synchronized with the currently selected student
